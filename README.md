# About
Hi there! Welcome to my Portfolio.

My name is Sebastian Ghafafian. I am originally from Leipzig, Germany where I grew up. I moved to Berlin to study mechanical engineering. After receiving my Bachelor's and Master's degree, I worked four years in engineering positions (strong focus on composite materials) in the field of sustainable energy. I quickly found out that I love programming and working with data to gain meaningful insights. This lead me to join the MicroMaster's program in Statistics and Data Science from MIT, where I received a very broad yet in-depth understanding for statistics and machine learning algorithms.

Currently, I am looking for job oppurtunities in the field of data science or engineering where I can leverage my data related skill set. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email or to check out my [resume](https://github.com/SebastianGhafafian/Portfolio/blob/main/docs/assets/resume/CV_SebastianGhafafian.pdf).

I am a passionate learner and I love walking through life picking up new skills along the way. Currently, learning to play the guitar and to speak Armenian keep the brain juices flowing. Besides that, I have a weird passion for fixing or repairing broken things.

## Projects

Feel free to check out my projects related to data science. 

### [Exploratory Data Analysis of the Data Science Job market](https://sebastianghafafian.github.io/Portfolio/EDA.html)

This projects looks at a data set published by Glassdoor about job postings in America realted to the field of data. The project entails cleaning the data, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis drawing insights about the job market and desired skills and potential employers in the LA area.

### [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect circles in noisy images](https://sebastianghafafian.github.io/Portfolio/CNN.html)

To get hand-on experience with the Pytorch libraries I created this small project which can be broken down in the follwing steps:
* creating a data set of noisy grayscale images containng a circle of variable size and position
* building and training a CNN model to return the radius and position of the circle using Google Colab
* model verification and visualization of the model's performance
